INFO:
I’m thrilled to share my latest Machine Learning deployment aimed at forecasting fire risk in Algeria’s forests, using a unique dataset from two key regions: Bejaia (northeast) and Sidi Bel-abbes (northwest). This project leverages environmental data to assess the Fire Weather Index (FWI) — a critical indicator for anticipating fire risks.

🌍 Dataset Highlights:

Period: June - September 2012
Data Points: 244 instances with factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and comprehensive fire risk indexes (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI)
Classes: Fire vs. Not Fire — with 138 Fire instances and 106 Not Fire instances
